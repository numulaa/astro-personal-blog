I am a software engineer. I am building fast, accessible web apps with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

I focus on creating user-friendly interfaces that solve real-world problems, backed by clean architecture and scalable systems using Node.js, Express, and Firebase.

I turn inefficiencies into intuitive digital solutions that drive business results.
