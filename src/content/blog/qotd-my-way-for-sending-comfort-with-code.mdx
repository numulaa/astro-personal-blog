title: Quran of the Day, My Way for Sending Comfort with Code
summary: To support a friend going through a tough time, I built "Quran of the Day"—a simple web app that shares random Quran verses for comfort and peace. This small project reminded me that code isn't just code. It’s love, care, and intention—translated into pixels.

What if you could send comfort to someone you love, even when you're miles apart?

## How I got the idea

On June 14th, 2022, my friends and I celebrated eight years of friendship.  
Instead of gifts, we exchanged letters and read it in front of each other.

In my letter, I told a dear friend how much her presence had meant to me, especially during a time when we were drowning in studies after weeks of skipping class for school competitions.

I still remember the day she gently closed my textbooks and said, _"Let's take a break from studying. Let's recite the Quran together."_

That moment changed everything.  
I felt calmer, lighter, and more peaceful. Studying became easier. And somehow, I didn't feel rushed to catch up with everything. In the end the exams went surprisingly smoothly.

After listening to the letter being read, she texted me promptly:  
_"I’ve been struggling lately. Your letter reminded me... maybe I need to return to the Quran to find my peace again."_

Her words broke my heart and lit a spark inside me. I wished I could be there, keeping her company. Unfortunately, I couldn't, distance made it impossible. So, I decided to create an app to be my substitute, something that could stay by her side when I couldn't.

## How I built it

I built the Quran of The Day app with one goal: simplicity. So I built it with simple tech stacks, no frameworks, no libraries, no distractions. Just clean, like a hand-written code :)

- I used HTM and CSS for structure and design
- JavaScript to pull random verse from Quran API
- Normalize.css and Reset.css to keep everything looking smooth across browsers.

## Final Thoughts

As I stated before, my goal is to build a very simple app. Turns out that building "simple" isn't so simple. I needed to find the right API, designing for true minimalism app which isn't just for "empty-looking" app but thoughtfully clear and peaceful. Some friends gave me constructive feedbacks on how the app looks so they can read it better.

It then once again, taught me that behind every app, there's a human story. Even the smallest app is started and crafted with a big heart, imagine the impact of a truly big one!
